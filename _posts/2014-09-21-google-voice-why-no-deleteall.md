## Remove Google Voice messages

Today I realized that there are about 2000 of messages / voicemail in my [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) account. By default Google will only allow 10 messages to be removed in one shot. Then you'll find deleted messages in "History" which you also need to clean up.

I hate to leave all this text about me laying around on Google servers.

So here's the gist of a code that will remove all of your messages from Google voice.

*WARNING: this code will delete everything from your account. So use it cautiously!*
