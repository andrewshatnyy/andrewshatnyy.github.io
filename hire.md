## I am for Hire.

I am a curious, self-directed web professional constantly staying up-to-date with latest technologies.

For the past few years I have been working with startups (< 5 devs). I enjoy being able to move across the stack freely. It could be an infrastructure(docker deploys) _I am not looking for dev-ops position_, Rails middleware coding, or UI/UX solutions to deliver great experience to clients.

I prefer to work on single page applications where Javascript treated with respect. I trust separation of API and Front-end is the way to go these days.

Also I enjoy designing builds (Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Webpack) allowing for separate deploys. RequireJs is not a threat for me I've done many projects where application needs to be spit in AMD modules for deferred loading.

I value my free time which I use to learn new technologies which can potentially uplift my team performance.

I feel safe in following:
 - JavaScript (Backbone.js, Node, Express, Koa) (yet to build production app with React.js,Angular.js)
 - Ruby (Goliath, Event-Machine, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails), eCommerce (Spree), Nginx
 - Elixir (OTP, Phoenix)

> Specialties: JavaScript, Backbone.js, Angular, CoffeeScript, SASS, LESS, Node.js, Ruby, EventMachine, Ruby On Rails, Bash scripting, Power Shell, Vagrant virtualization with Docker containers, Gulp, Yeoman, REST api, Require.js, Elixir (erlang), Aptible
